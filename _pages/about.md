Recently graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (**UCLA**), where I was advised by [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/lab/) and [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree with honours in Computer Science & Engineering from JIIT, India.

During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work as a Teaching Associate (formerly Teaching Assistant) at UCLA. You can find my teaching reviews and ratings [here](https://lalitbhagat7.github.io/teaching/).

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy indulging in my creative hobbies, such as **photography**, sketching, and reading. Some of my photographic work has been featured on the social media pages of @ucla on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

**Research Interests:** Computer Vision, Generative AI, Human-AI interaction
