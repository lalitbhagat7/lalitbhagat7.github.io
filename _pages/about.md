I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (**UCLA**), where I was advised by [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/lab/) and [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). I was honored to receive the prestigious Graduate Council Diversity Fellowship at UCLA, which significantly supported my education journey. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science & Engineering from JIIT, India.

During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work as a Teaching Associate (formerly Teaching Assistant) six times for five different courses at UCLA, which ignited my passion for teaching. You can check out my teaching reviews.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy indulging in my creative hobbies, such as **photography**, sketching, and reading. Some of my photographic work has been featured on the social media pages of @ucla on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.

**Research Interests:** Computer Vision, Generative AI, Human-AI interaction
