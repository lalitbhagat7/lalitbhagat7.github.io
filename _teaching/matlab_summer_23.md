Anonymous Student Evaluations
======

Lalit was an amazing TA. From the very beginning, he made sure that the discussion was engaging and
worth while for everyone who attended. He provided livescripts for Matlab that we were able to
download and edit ourselves, so we got hands-on practice with the content he was teaching and
reviewing. He would always push us to be active participants, sometimes waiting a while to allow
everyone to show that they are following along and make sure no one is left behind. Every single
discussion section benefitted me greatly and Lalit's teachings gave me so much confidence and made
the class very enjoyable. He also had very funny memes that always made me smile.

Lalit was very helpful when he answered his emails and made me feel comfortable asking questions.
His sections did a good job of going over similar material to the homework and projects. Thanks Lalit!

Such an organized and understanding TA! He even created cute and specific Matlab discussions to help
us that I know took a long time. He also always wants us to participate.

The real strengths of this teaching assistant and course is that the person showed he very much cared
for the students and really wanted participation and interaction to the students learn. The presentations
were very much well organized and were available even after discussion. Due to my schedule, I was not
able to go to many of the lab discussions, but I have heard it was very helpful in going over concepts
and to better understanding that would later help when doing assignments. In terms of weaknesses,
due to only seeing the teaching assistant once per week, it was hard to reach out and receive the
desired information outside of section.

The TA always had us participate and was really good about answering questions and helping when we
were stuck.

The TA is very knowledgeable about Matlab programming. He prepared an interactive programming
page every week for us to learn coding. He graded homeworks very leniently

Our TA was very good at explaining things and always made himself available to answer any questions.
Overall, Lalit was a great TA!

He was very caring and paced the material to be achievable.

I really appreciate the lab presentation using live script. This is a very good, interactive way of teaching
and I get good practice. Attending the lab is very helpful and interesting.

The TA tried to make lab sections as interactive as possible, which is great. Questions were always
welcome. The sections really helped me with completing the homework.

I really enjoyed that the TA walked the students through different acitivites to
help up practice our skills. I wish that this guidance lasted the rest of the weeks. Although having the
discussion be office hours for the last three weeks can be beneficial.

The TA was great, and made sure to touch on topics that would be asked in the homework. He also
made sure to elaborate further on all of the homework, and gave tips on how to figure out problems. He was very knowledgable and caring about student understanding.

This T.A. seemed very friendly and open to questions. He put in the extra effort, and despite this being a remote class, he vowed to send people chocolates in the mail for participation during labs.

great TA and very helpful. Explained the material well

The posted slides were useful

Very helpful!

What do you think was the best part about the lab section/TA? 
======

The live scripts make it very interactive, keeps me engaged, and allows me to practice the skills I just learned.

I was very happy with everything you did!

The homework hints really helped clear some confusion and gave me confidence.

I got to understand new concepts.

the examples, and showing us multiple ways to solve a problem

The live scripts were once again very helpful in hammering in the concepts and helping with the homework. Thank you!!!

Going over similar problems that were on the homework

Code examples with descriptions

Thank you so much! It was very helpful
