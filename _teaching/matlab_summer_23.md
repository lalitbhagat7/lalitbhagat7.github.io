Anonymous Student Evaluations
======

Lalit was very helpful when he answered his emails and made me feel comfortable asking questions.
His sections did a good job of going over similar material to the homework and projects. Thanks Lalit!

Our TA was very good at explaining things and always made himself available to answer any questions.
Overall, Lalit was a great TA!

The TA tried to make lab sections as interactive as possible, which is great. Questions were always
welcome. The sections really helped me with completing the homework.

The TA was great, and made sure to touch on topics that would be asked in the homework. He also
made sure to elaborate further on all of the homework, and gave tips on how to figure out problems. He was very knowledgable and caring about student understanding.

This T.A. seemed very friendly and open to questions. He put in the extra effort, and despite this being a remote class, he vowed to send people chocolates in the mail for participation during labs.

Very helpful!

The live scripts make it very interactive, keeps me engaged, and allows me to practice the skills I just learned.

I was very happy with everything you did!

The homework hints really helped clear some confusion and gave me confidence.

I got to understand new concepts.

the examples, and showing us multiple ways to solve a problem

The live scripts were once again very helpful in hammering in the concepts and helping with the homework. Thank you!!!
