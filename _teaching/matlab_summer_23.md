What do you think was the best part about the lab section/TA? 
======

The live scripts make it very interactive, keeps me engaged, and allows me to practice the skills I just learned.

I was very happy with everything you did!

The homework hints really helped clear some confusion and gave me confidence.

I got to understand new concepts.

the examples, and showing us multiple ways to solve a problem

The live scripts were once again very helpful in hammering in the concepts and helping with the homework. Thank you!!!

Going over similar problems that were on the homework
