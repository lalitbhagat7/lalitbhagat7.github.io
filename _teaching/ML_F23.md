I think the TA session is awesome.

Lalit was helpful in helping us understand complex concepts. Machine learning isn't an easy topic, especially for someone with a Business background, and I learned a lot every time I went to his TA sessions. He is willing to lend a hand and offer help whenever he can.

strengths: structured material, good compliment and explanation provided for course material weakness: since we only have limited time, it's important to have the key concept delivered in the most efficient ways

Lalit is better than the professor.

Very personable and approachable. Provided a personalized learning experience even with 80 people in each session

Your TA session really helped me a lot in understanding the course material and I appreciate the practicality of your tips/advices.

Open for communications, ready to help and support. Knows material and able to share it easily

Very engaging sessions and really helped clear a lot of basic concepts that were not clarified in the class

Lalit effectively explained concepts from the lecture and cleared any confusion we had from our lecture with the professor. Great TA.

Very clear at explaining material and made it easy to understand.

really helpfulllllllll

Great and well organized TA lab sessions. Thank you for having us for the past 5 weeks!

Codes and code explanations are very helpful!

Lalit is an excellent TA and is very knowledgeable. I got to learn more from his TA sessions than from the professor himself. Lalit also knows his stuff well and his TA sessions are very interactive, informative and engaging.

LinkedIn tutorial very helpful

Lalit does such a good job to curate the material to the learning experience of the student. He goes to great lengths to make sure what he is covering is not only relevant to the class but is also easy to understand and complements the theoretical concepts we have learned in class.

He also makes sure the session is interactive and we are involved in the session and not just listening.

real strengths: accommodate to different students needs in learning.

Lalit helped me to gain a better understanding of the course material

strengths -- prepare the class well, and explain material clear

Lalit is a very responsible and caring TA. He is well-prepared for every TA session and gives concrete explanation for the topics that I have trouble to understand.

great TA sessions! it was NOT boring at all, it was very engaging. The chocolate was good haha. The colab files were very organized and fun to study and read. The fact that we didn't just sit and listen and we had the chance to code while learning was very efficient

Lalit Bhagat is very passionate about what he teaches and he's very knowledge in his field. He knows his stuff. He also gives out additional career search suggestions for us. He's really helpful!

The TA session was very helpful and Lalit was able to explain things clearly.

Lalit is more helpful than the professor in this course and he could explain the concepts more clearly.

Strength: great TA overall. Weakness: only lead the TA session instead of the entire curriculum :)

Strengths: Humble, Knowledgeable, Approachable
Weaknesses: I don't see any

Lalit has a great understanding of the concepts he taught us in our Machine Learning class. He was genuinely interested to help out students with their conceptual understanding and was too patient to listen to our issues during the class. Very helpful and knowledeable person with an honest intention to improve and learn on the go. Thank you!

Lalit was excellent as our TA for the Machine Learning course. Not only did he help us understand several important topics taught during the class lectures in TA hours, but also gave a lot of additional information related to learning more about the concepts. The TA sessions were very interactive and his advices for the course and beyond are very helpful. Thank you so much for all your cooperation and support! :)

Lalit gave a good practical coding introduction to the theoretical concepts covered in class. Overall his sessions were excellent. He could however improve his communication skills in terms of explaining the concepts.

Lalit was really invested in student's progress and learning throughout the course. Even outside the course material, he made sure share tips and tricks on subjects like internship applications and more. It was a true pleasure to get to attend his sessions.

Strengths - Clear communication, pace of speech, sense of humor

Lalit is highly knowledgable of ML applications in theory and in practice. He is further experienced in transferring his knowledge of the subject to students in understandable way without omitting any information. As a bonus, he is knowledgable of the trends in the industry, is up to date with the subject and has real-life experience, which he is happy and enthusiastic to share with students.

You are more helpful than the professor! Thank you!!

Lalit is a person who I believe a lot of us relate to. He creates a very comfortable environment for learning and clarifying doubts. He is also clearly knowledgeable about the contents of the class who he is the TA for

strengths: Lalit gives a real-world perspective, and explains in a easy to understand way with visualizations and well organized (and fun) materials
weakness: not familiar with some concepts (but not a big problem, we can easily find resources online)

The TA sessions were very helpful in building intuition about various ML concepts.
