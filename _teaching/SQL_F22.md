you were the best TA

You are a very wholehearted person... everyone might have said this to you.. but trust me everyone in MSBA likes you
people who hasd minimial interactions also really admire you. 

thanks for all the help. Best TA 

Humility is your biggest asset. Please do not ever change.

I really admire your achievement and determination. I could feel your strong interest in machine learning

we need more TAs like you, other TAs are scary to approach

you were the NICEST ta, I will miss you
