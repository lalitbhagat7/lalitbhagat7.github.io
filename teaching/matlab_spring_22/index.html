He made coming to discussion feel worthwhile and made the concepts we needed to know in order to be successful in the course easily understandable. He was the most approachable, kindest teaching assistant as well and you could tell he genuinely cares about his students understanding the material.”</p> <p>“Lalit was such an amazing TA this quarter. He is very knowledgeable and makes students feel welcome to ask any questions. He responds to emails quickly and addresses any questions or concerns regarding the homework, even on weekends, which was very much appreciated. All professors should take have TAs like Lalit since he wants the students the learn and is great at teaching. Overall, I am glad to have taken this class Spring quarter and to have had an amazing TA like him.”</p> <p>“Lalit was a super helpful teaching assistant. He was always reachable by email and was super kind in office hours as well. In section, it was obvious that he cared about students’ learning as he made sure to always ask us questions and ask if there was anything that we were struggling on. He also gave us chocolates when we answered questions, which was not necessary but was very much appreciated! I would highly recommend Lalit as a TA.”</p> <p>“Lalit has been an exceptionally friendly and helpful TA, one of the best experiences I had at UCLA, especially with a class that emphasizes coding. He has demonstrated a capability in engaging with the class to encourage participation and involvement. He has been very tolerant of mistakes and generous with grading, aiming to let the student fully understand what the concept is and how it should be correctly done.”</p> <p>“Lalit’s lab section was very informative and engaging. He was very patient with the class and allowed us to truly understand each step of the answer to a question before moving onto the next. I found that attending his lab was very helpful for completing the homework since he explains lecture material for the second time and goes through it thoroughly. Overall, I had an amazing experience with Lalit’s lab section.”</p> <p>“Lalit was a great TA this quarter. I really appreciated him taking the time to explain everything in detail and you could tell that he actually cared about the students in his interactions with us. He was also very responsive and often available by email which was very helpful.”</p> <p>“The TA was great and did a good job of preparing review sessions for each week. I felt like it was worth coming just to get the practice in and reinforce the harder topics, and we would end up doing the same kind of stuff on homeworks. If anything, class discussions would sometimes be lacking because students were quiet and wouldn’t want to try to answer questions, but I think Lalit did a good job of recognizing the topics that everyone in the class needed more help on.”</p> <p>“Lalit was super knowledgeable and made discussion very interactive. He had no weaknesses!!”</p> <p>“The TA made discussions interactive and encouraged participation. The discussions were very helpful towards my learning and homework assignments. Overall, amazing TA.”</p> <p>“Great TA, kind and knowledgeable”</p> <p>“I thought Lalit was really helpful and did a good job teaching although sometimes it felt like he was exasperated by us.”</p> <p>“Lalit is very helpful, knowledgeable, and approachable/kind.”</p> <p>“Lalit was a very nice TA—in office hours, he answered questions super well and always waited for others to ask questions. He is also responsive over emails.”</p> <p>“He is very attentive, he reviews any topics we don’t understand and he explains in a relatively easy way to understand.”</p> <p>“I really liked the way Lalit would involve students during discussion to improve engagement. I think a weakness is not having comprehensive notes to look back on.”</p> <p>“Lalit definitely covered the bases as a TA, and I can tell that he really cared about us benefiting from the lab section. I appreciated his respect for our time, and I wish I could have attended more of his sections. I think it was a little bit hard to understand him at times, but I also always was able to figure out what he meant. He made an effort to interact with the class, and although we weren’t very responsive (tough crowd), I still noticed and it made him feel more approachable.”</p> <p>“TA worked hard to make the discussion engaging and provide useful information that would help us with our homework. He was also available during his office hours and would always help when needed. Discussions we’re well structured and supported the lecture material.”</p> <p>“Very good TA.”</p> <p>“Lalit was super helpful and I would not have been able to succeed in this class without his help. He had no weaknesses!!!”</p> <p>“TA is really good”</p> <p>“TA was very thorough and went through important things in discussions, focused on things that would appear similar on homeworks, graded fairly”</p> <p>“The TA is very understanding and makes himself a resource to everyone.”</p> <p>“The TA was great! Same comments as before.”</p> <p>“Very helpful!”</p> <p>“I love Lalit Bhagat. He is the best TA ever. Very helpful and very nice. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat. I love Lalit Bhagat.
